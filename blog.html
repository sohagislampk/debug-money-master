        <h1 class="title">Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage :</h1>
        <p class="white">localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs and are near identical with the
            sole
            exception of persistence. sessionStorage is only available for the duration of the browser session and on
            the
            other hand local storage stored data.</p>
        <p class="white">localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed
            within
            client scripts between pages. The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or
            changed
            from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related
            data
            within applications.

            <h3>Local storage has 4 methods:</h3>
            <li>setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It is used to

                -- localStorage.setItem(key, value)</li>
            <li>getItem() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the value stored
                with a particular key name. <br>

        <h1 class="title">Difference Between Global Scope and Block Scope :</h1>
        <p class="white ">The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript
            variables have only two scopes.
            <br>
            Global Variables − A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your
            JavaScript code.
            <br>
            Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function
            parameters are always local to that function.
            <br>
            Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name.
            If
            you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively
            hide
            the global variable.

        <h1 class="title">How Java Scripts Event loop Works?</h1>
        <p class="white ">The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing
            callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks
            the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call
            Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>

        <h1 class="title">How many ways can we get Undefined in Javascript :</h1>
        <p class="white">undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope.
            The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

            In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not
            the case, avoid overriding it.)

            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
            undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
            undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
